Prompt:
You are a knowledge graph extraction assistant.

Generate a knowledge graph as complete as possible for the text below. The output should be a list of unique nodes and edges suitable for knowledge graph construction in KGQA and Graph RAG. Nodes typically represent entities (stages, organisms, objects, concepts) and edges represent relations (transformations, interactions, attributes, locations).

Internally, you should ask yourself questions such as:
- What are the key entities in this text?
- What lifecycle events or transformations occur?
- How should they be connected as relations?

However, do NOT write these questions or reasoning out.
Only output the final nodes and edges as follows:

Output format:
nodes:
name|label
...

edges:
relation|from node|to node
...

Use the exact node names from the nodes list when specifying relationships.
Fields are separated by '|'.
No explanation, no comments, no code fences: just the 'nodes:' section and the 'edges:' section in plain text.

Text:
"""How Smell Works:
Smell begins when odor molecules enter the nasal cavity through the nostrils. These molecules then bind to specialized olfactory receptors located in the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. Each receptor is sensitive to specific odor molecules, allowing us to distinguish between different smells. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that send signals to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as a particular smell."""

Evaluator Feedback:
{
  "completeness": "partial",
  "correctness": "mixed",
  "duplication": "more than 30%",
  "overall": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "feedback": "Extraction is largely faithful to the passage (molecules → nasal cavity → bind receptors → trigger chemical reactions → signals → brain → perception). However there is redundancy and minor modeling issues: 'Olfactory epithelium' duplicated as 'Thin layer of tissue', 'Odor molecules' vs 'Specific odor molecules', and 'Smell' vs 'Particular smell'. Several edges (e.g., involves vs binds_to) are duplicative. Consider merging synonymous nodes, remove redundant edges, and keep node types/relations consistent to improve quality."
