Prompt:
Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Before extracting triples, generate knowledge about the entities in the text and potential relations between them. Here is an example:
Text: Leaves absorb sunlight. Knowledge: Leaves: plant_part; Sunlight: energy The following triples can be extracted considering the knowledge. Triples: (Leaves, absorb, Sunlight) 
Example ends here. Generate knowledge as shown in the example and extract knowledge triples from the input passage. Reason freely, but only output the final nodes and edges using this format:

Output format:
nodes:
name|label
...

edges:
relation|from node|to node
...

Use the exact node names from the nodes list when specifying relationships.
Fields are separated by '|'.
No explanation, no comments, no code fences: just the 'nodes:' section and the 'edges:' section in plain text.

"""How Smell Works:
Smell begins when odor molecules enter the nasal cavity through the nostrils. These molecules then bind to specialized olfactory receptors located in the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. Each receptor is sensitive to specific odor molecules, allowing us to distinguish between different smells. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that send signals to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as a particular smell."""

Evaluator Feedback:
{
  "completeness": "partial",
  "correctness": "mixed",
  "duplication": "less than 30%",
  "overall": 0.76,
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "feedback": "Most key entities and relations are present (odor molecules, receptors, epithelium, binding, chemical reactions, signals, brain interpretation). Problems: one edge is semantically odd ('occurs_when|Odor molecule binding|Odor molecules' — should link the event as involving molecules and receptors), missing explicit relation that receptors/neurons generate/send the signals (receptor -> Signals), and minor direction/label issues (e.g., 'processes|Brain|Signals' is okay but could be clearer as 'Brain processes Signals' vs signal->brain). There are a couple of duplicate/overlapping nodes (Odor molecules vs Specific odor molecules; Smell vs Particular smell). Overall extraction is mostly faithful but has some mapping and relation granularity issues."
