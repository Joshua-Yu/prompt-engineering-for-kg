Prompt:
You are a senior ontologist specializing in biological knowledge graphs for Question Answering (KGQA) and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG).

Generate a knowledge graph as complete as possible for the text below. The output should be a list of unique nodes and edges suitable for knowledge graph construction in KGQA and Graph RAG. Nodes typically represent entities (stages, organisms, objects, concepts) and edges represent relations (transformations, interactions, attributes, locations).

Use concise but informative labels for each node (e.g., organism, stage, plant_part, behavior, location).
Use relation names that are suitable for real-world KG schemas (e.g., hatches_into, transforms_into, feeds_on, lays_on, located_in).

Output only in the following format:

Output format:
nodes:
name|label
...

edges:
relation|from node|to node
...

Use the exact node names from the nodes list when specifying relationships.
Fields are separated by '|'.
No explanation, no comments, no code fences: just the 'nodes:' section and the 'edges:' section in plain text.

"""How Smell Works:
Smell begins when odor molecules enter the nasal cavity through the nostrils. These molecules then bind to specialized olfactory receptors located in the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. Each receptor is sensitive to specific odor molecules, allowing us to distinguish between different smells. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that send signals to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as a particular smell."""

  "feedback": "The extraction captures most key entities and relationships, but misses the specificity of receptors being sensitive to specific odor molecules. The edge 'located_in|nasal_cavity|nostrils' is incorrect; nostrils are part of the nasal cavity, not the other way around. The rest of the nodes and edges are mostly correct, with no duplication."
