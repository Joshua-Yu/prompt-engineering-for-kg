Prompt:
Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use a few examples:
Text: A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: Caterpillar; Butterfly What do you know about the entities? Caterpillar: organism; Butterfly: organism Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: Caterpillar transforms into Butterfly Let's make a draft of the triples. (Caterpillar, transforms_into, Butterfly); (Butterfly, transforms_into, Caterpillar) Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: (Butterfly, transforms_into, Caterpillar). Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: Butterflies do not transform back into caterpillars. Therefore, final triples should be: (Caterpillar, transforms_into, Butterfly).
Think like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Only output the final nodes and edges in this format:

Output format:
nodes:
name|label
...

edges:
relation|from node|to node
...

Use the exact node names from the nodes list when specifying relationships.
Fields are separated by '|'.
No explanation, no comments, no code fences: just the 'nodes:' section and the 'edges:' section in plain text.

Text:
"""How Smell Works:
Smell begins when odor molecules enter the nasal cavity through the nostrils. These molecules then bind to specialized olfactory receptors located in the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. Each receptor is sensitive to specific odor molecules, allowing us to distinguish between different smells. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that send signals to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as a particular smell."""

  "feedback": "The extraction captures most key entities and relationships but misses some details. The 'Signals' node is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, leading to a correctness issue. The relationship 'processed_as' should involve the brain processing signals into smells, which is not accurately captured. Overall, the extraction is mostly correct but lacks some completeness and has a minor correctness issue."
