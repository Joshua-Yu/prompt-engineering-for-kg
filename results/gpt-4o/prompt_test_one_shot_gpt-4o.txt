Prompt:
You are an expert knowledge graph extractor.

Generate a knowledge graph as complete as possible for the text below. The output should be a list of unique nodes and edges suitable for knowledge graph construction in KGQA and Graph RAG. Nodes typically represent entities (stages, organisms, objects, concepts) and edges represent relations (transformations, interactions, attributes, locations).

Follow the format and style of this example:

Example text:
"Water evaporates from the ocean surface."

Example output:
nodes:
Water|substance
Ocean surface|location

edges:
evaporates_from|Water|Ocean surface

Now process the following text.

Output format:
nodes:
name|label
...

edges:
relation|from node|to node
...

Use the exact node names from the nodes list when specifying relationships.
Fields are separated by '|'.
No explanation, no comments, no code fences: just the 'nodes:' section and the 'edges:' section in plain text.

Text:
"""How Smell Works:
Smell begins when odor molecules enter the nasal cavity through the nostrils. These molecules then bind to specialized olfactory receptors located in the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. Each receptor is sensitive to specific odor molecules, allowing us to distinguish between different smells. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that send signals to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as a particular smell."""

  "overall": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "feedback": "The extraction captures many key entities and relations, but there are some issues. The node 'Receptor' is a duplicate of 'Olfactory receptors'. The edge 'begins_when' is incorrect as it implies a direct relationship between 'Smell' and 'Odor molecules', which is not explicitly stated. The relation 'processed_and_interpreted_as' could be more accurately described as 'interpreted_as'. Overall, the extraction is mostly correct but could be improved for completeness and precision."
